<h2>Game 4</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fight through the world and eliminate all of the competition for the job.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should have to think about how to approach the battles to keep their health up between battles.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
RPG
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
This game features two separate states:<p>
World Map:<p>
Move around with the arrow keys and run into enemies to fight them.<p>
Battle:<p>
Click the attack or defend button to take your turn.  Defending significantly reduces the amount of damage the enemy deals to you, especially if the enemy crits.
The first player to hit 0 health loses.  Health is not restored between battles unless the player levels up at the end of the battle.  Winning battles grants experience, 
which will eventually cause you to level up.  Leveling up increases all of your stats and fully heals you.  Defeat all 5 enemies to win the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the effectiveness of switching between two styles of gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features both exploration and a turn based combat system.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You had an interview that you thought went well, but after hearing a rumor that someone else was likely to get the job, you decide to...  increase your odds.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
RPG fans.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that attempting to time the use of defend to reduce the damage of the enemy's critical strikes will be the most effective strategy.
</li>
